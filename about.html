        <h1>About</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>With over five years of expertise in software development and cybersecurity, I help organizations build
                secure, efficient digital solutions.</p>

            <p>My technical foundation is built on full-stack development experience across multiple technologies,
                complemented by specialized knowledge in cybersecurity. This combination allows me to develop solutions
                that are both functionally robust and inherently secure. In my career, I have been involved in projects
                of various sizes, from short-term compliance reviews, to development and auditing of enterprise-grade
                software.</p>

            <p>My approach emphasizes clear communication, technical excellence, and business value.</p>

            <p>Based in Slovenia and operating as a registered sole proprietorship, I specialize in B2B relationships
                and contract-based engagements that provide flexibility and focused expertise without the overhead of
                traditional employment structures.</p>
