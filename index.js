const message = `Yeah, I developed this site in pure HTML and CSS. And before you ask why, think about this: when is the last time you thought about the environmental impact of the software you write or use? I bet it's been a while. Software relies on hardware, hardware consumes energy, and that energy is finite. Data centers don't just spawn out of thin air. Internet is a complex net of computer systems that consumes energy. It's important that we do our best in reducing software's carbon footprint. Modern software relies on the fact that the hardware is cheap and abundant. When is the last time you've heard an engineer talking about memory/storage/power constraints? Unless you work in IoT or with embedded systems, you probably haven't. It's important to be aware that "flasy" doesn't always translate to "good". This website, for example, contains all the information one needs to know about me. I'd argue that it's presented in a way that's both clean and accessible.

Furthermore, complexity is a double-edged sword. By using frameworks, you're making a bet on someone else's code. By using any dependency, you're making a bet that it's not malicious, and that it does not contain malicious transient dependencies. When is the last time you reviewed third-party code imported into your project? Look, I'm not trying to scare you or be rude, but for the most part, developers just wanna close Jira tickets and go home. Fine. I don't blame them. It's just that I'm not like that. For me, the primary concern is always going to be that me (or the client) provides a service to users in a way that keeps them safe. I don't need laws to tell me that. It's common sense. And I'm sure that if you're a stakeholder reading this, you're probably nodding your head. If it's your money and livelihood at stake, you'd be crazy to risk it all. It's really difficult to get it right, and especially so when you're under pressure. I get it. I've been working in stressful environments my whole career. When you need someone to help you make sure the technical side is taken care of, the last thing you want is to be left alone when something happens. Because it will. It always does. That's why I combine my knowledge of cybersecurity and software engineering. Otherwise, I'm just another ticket-closing developer who (most likely) only cares about getting paid. Too bad. Not me.

Lastly, know that ultimately, we're all just humans. We have opinions. Thoughts. Feelings. We're not perfect. We make mistakes. We cannot "just do it right". That's why we gotta talk. We simply cannot afford to be silent. It's our responsibility and duty to each other: be better, do better. My only promise is that I'll be honest. I'll be transparent. I'll tell you how it is. And we'll grow together.

I wish you a lovely day. I hope you'll take time to think about the things I've written. In case our paths never cross again, please take care, and stay safe. World needs more good people. Peace out.`;
